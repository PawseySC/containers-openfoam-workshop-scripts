# Workshop on the usage of OpenFOAM containers at Pawsey

**Organisers**: Alexis Espinosa (PawseySC) and Marco De La Pierre (PawseySC)

The use of containers has become an attractive framework for several areas of research supported by Pawsey (including bioinformatics and machine learning, among others). 

**Now, Pawsey supports the usage of OpenFOAM containers.** For the most recent versions of OpenFOAM (and some others), Pawsey have prebuilt and tested Singularity containers.

This repository contains material for the exercises of the workshop.
